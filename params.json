{"name":"Raspberry Pi AirPlay Speakers","tagline":"Easily make your own $25 AirPlay Speakers","body":"Jordan Burgess' Raspberry Pi iOS 6 Airplay installation procedure has been condensed into one simple shell script, and is easily installable by any beginner!\r\n\r\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\r\n1. Make sure your running Debian on your Pi.\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Raspbian Wheezy (The official OS) (Recommended)</li>\r\n      <li>Occidentals (From Adafruit)</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n2. If this is a new install, perform inital setup in Raspi-config (The menu that loads when you first boot your Pi)  \r\n(You can also access it by typing \"sudo raspi-config\" into the terminal)\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Expand the Root Partition</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Installation</h3>\r\n<p>Here's the fun part: the installation.  I've condensed it down to the following six commands: just copy and paste them one by one into the terminal:</p>\r\n\r\n    sudo apt-get install git-core\r\n    git clone https://github.com/LikeABoss-001/AirPi-Installation.git\r\n    cd AirPi-Installation\r\n    sudo cp install2.sh ..\r\n    cd\r\n    sudo bash install2.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That's it!  Go to your iOS device, go into the Music app, and a new Airplay icon should be there.</p>\r\n<p>If this worked for you, let me know in the comments at my blog, <a href=\"justin.swimlikepros.com\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>For More:</h3>\r\nFollow my blog: <a href=\"justin.swimlikepros.com\">justin.swimlikepros.com</a>\r\n\r\nFollow me on Twitter: <a class=\"twitter-timeline\" href=\"https://twitter.com/justin_harbour\" data-widget-id=\"260414662020046848\">@justin_harbour</a>\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-40164913-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
